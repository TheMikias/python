1.1  Your First Program
Programming in Python  To introduce you to developing Python programs, we break the process down into two steps. 
To program in Python, you need to:
•   Compose a program by typing it into a file named, say, myprogram.py.
•   Run (or execute) it by typing python myprogram.py in the terminal window.
* Composing a program.  A Python program is nothing more than a sequence of
characters, like a paragraph or a poem, stored in a file whose name has a .py exten-
sion. To compose one, therefore, you need simply define that sequence of charac-
ters, in the same way as you do for email or any other computer application.
* Executing a program.  Once you compose the program, you can run (or execute) it. This is the exciting part, 
where your program takes control of your computer (within the constraints of what Python allows).
the Python interpreter directs your computer to follow these instructions. Throughout this book we use the term 
executing or running to refer to the combination of compiling and interpreting a program (as in “When Python 
executes this program…”).
* Errors.  It is easy to blur the distinction among editing, compiling, and interpreting programs.
 You should keep them separate in your mind when you are learning to program, to better understand the 
 effects of the errors that inevitably arise.
* Input and output  Typically, we want to provide input to our programs—that is, data that they can process to
 produce  a result. The simplest way to provide input data is illustrated in useargument.
